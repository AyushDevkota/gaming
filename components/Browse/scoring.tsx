        Explore the undersea city of Rapture, a haven for society`&apos;`s
        greatest minds that has devolved into a dystopian nightmare wrought by
        one man`&apos;`s hubris. Amidst the waterlogged ruins, a new ecosystem
        has emerged, where deranged Splicers hunt down the Little Sisters who
        would be helpless without their hulking Big Daddy guardians. Your only
        hopes for survival are quick thinking, reclaimed weaponry, and
        superhuman powers granted by DNA-altering Plasmids. To defeat
        Rapture`&apos;`s mutated monsters, you must become one.
